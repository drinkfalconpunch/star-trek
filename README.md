# star-trek
A peronal project where I paint a happy little NLP package for Star Trek show scripts. 
This package has it all: a spooky spooder for corralling all the scripts, a text parsing module to discover who talked about who's momma, and finally a NLP module to see what trends exist in the Star Trek universe.
